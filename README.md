What have I learned:
* Due to NGINX-Ingress, the websocket and the document itself might not come from the same pod
* MQTT servers are awesome as long as you stay organized
* DENO IS AWESOME
* Healthchecks are optional but kinda neat if you want zero downtime
* Docker registry pushing is awesome
* I need to find a way to automate uploading stuff (CI/CD)
